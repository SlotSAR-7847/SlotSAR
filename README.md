# SlotSAR
**AAAI 2026 Anonymous Submission**

This repository contains the implementation of SlotSAR, a slot attention-based method for unsupervised target-clutter disentanglement in SAR images.

## Overview
SlotSAR is built upon the following two repositories: [Parametric Scattering Networks (WSN)](https://github.com/bentherien/parametricScatteringNetworks.git), [SARATR-X](https://github.com/waterdisappear/SARATR-X.git)

We thank the authors of both projects for providing high-quality codebases that made this work possible.

## Pretrained Weights

To use the SARATR-X backbone, please download the pretrained weights from the following link: **SARATR-X Checkpoint**: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AE_6wLadOCgwm7nEmtohyRrxKEWozcuK/view?usp=sharing)

## How to Run

Once all dependencies are installed and the pretrained weights are downloaded, you can execute the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Please refer to the dataset and configuration used in `ATRNet-STAR`: **ATRNet-STAR Full Dataset and Setup**: [https://github.com/waterdisappear/ATRNet-STAR.git](https://github.com/waterdisappear/ATRNet-STAR.git)

## Acknowledgements

We would like to sincerely thank the contributors of the SARATR-X and Parametric Scattering Networks projects for making their source code publicly available. We also appreciate the support and sharing of data that made this research possible.
